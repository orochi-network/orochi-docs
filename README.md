# ðŸ’• Orochi Network

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Orochi Network provides missing components to "run" the game in the decentralized fashion. It covers wide range of needs from trustless randomness to verifiable computation.
{% endhint %}

## Getting Started

### Unique selling points:

**High performance:** Orochi Network provides semi-native performance with Verifiable WebAssembly Runtime.

**Zero latency:** Orochi Network makes all critical components to be available at the runtime that reduces latency significantly.

**Non-blocking:** Orochi Network terminated third party interactive there is no need for awaiting the third party responses.

**Decentralized:** Orochi Network uses validity proof to secure the network and prove the computation process thus our network doesn't require third party trust.

**Seamless:** Orochi Network has an embedded WebAssembly runtime that can execute arbitrary given WebAssembly opcodes. It doesn't require a unique toolchain to compile a program to be compatible with Orochi Networkâ€™s runtime.
