| Denote                  | Description                                                                                                                   |

| $$S$$                   | Secret value which was generated by dealer                                                                                    |
| $$\{s_1, s_2,...s_i\}$$ | Share $$i^{th}$$ which will be dealt by dealer to corresponding verifier/participant $$p_i$$. This share was split from $$S$$ |
| $$P_i$$                 | Participant $$i^{th}$$                                                                                                        |
| $$k$$                   | Threshold of shares that is need to reconstruct $$S, 1 < k < i$$                                                              |
