# ðŸ¤– Protocol

## Epoch

Assuming that we have $$n$$ participants denote $$P_1, P_2, ... P_n$$. Each participant play two roles in our system dealer and verifier. Each participant $$P_i$$ have their own key-pair $$\{SK_i,PK_i\}$$ and the public key $$PK_i$$ is available to all other participants.

### Draw

All participants $$P_i$$ will need to generate their secret and also a randomness by using VRF with $$x$$ is the grand randomness of previous epoch. In the genesis epoch $$x$$ can be generated by combine participant hash of public key.

We have $$x_0$$ at genesis epoch:

$$
x_0=H(PK_1) \oplus H(PK_2) \oplus ... \oplus H(PK_i)
$$

For other epoch we have:

$$
\{r_i,\pi_x\}=f_{SK}(x)
$$

### Split

$$P_i$$ is also know as dealer $$D_i$$ will split their $$r_i$$ to shares $$\{s_{i1}, s_{i2},...,s_{in}\}$$, all other participants need $$t$$ shares to reconstruct $$r_i$$, $$0 \leq t \leq n$$. In our protocol we choose $$\frac{n}{2} < t < \frac{3n}{4}$$

Each participant can forge their message $$M_{s_{ij}}$$ corresponding to the share $$s_{ij}$$

$$
M_{ij}=E_{ij}(s_{ij}){+\!\!\!\!+\,}Proof_{P_i}
$$

### Gossip

To make sure the participant $$P_i$$ won't able to deal all the shares to his colluding party. We will need an improvement. They need to draw distribution param $$d_i$$ by using VRF.

$$
\{d_i,\pi_{H(x)}\} = f_{SK_i}(H(x))
$$

We assume that node id of participant is the digest of their public key

$$
N_i=H(PK_i)
$$

Share $$i^{th}$$ will be distributed the part&#x20;
