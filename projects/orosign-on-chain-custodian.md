# üêã Orosign: On-chain Custodian

## Problem

* Advanced features aren't available for everyone
* Operating a multisig wallet is require technical knowledge
* Managing/operating a multisig wallet is too painful
* There is no such dedicated interface for decentralized gaming

## Orosign's Features

**Friendly UI/UX:** The UI/UX is easy to use even for non-crypto users.

**On-chain custodian:** Orosign allows customers to create their own multisig wallet with minimal cost. Orosign also improves the user's experience in terms of asset management.

**Self-managed:** Orosign allows customers to customize the smart contract to meet their own needs.

**Security:** Off-chain signing and verification were used to secure the signing process. All proofs are verified independently with secp256k1 thus the fund is safe as long as the majority private keys are safe.
