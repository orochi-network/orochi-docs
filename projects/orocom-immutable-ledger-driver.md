# ðŸ›° Orocom: Immutable Ledger Driver

## Problem

* Data isn't available during the runtime
* Cost to store data on-chain is too expensive
* We can't guarantee data correctness if store the data off-chain
* Getting data via Oracle is too expensive

## Orocom's Features

**High performance:** All data can be accessible immediately in the runtime environment with a lowest cost

**Data availability:** It can be compared to normal database, you can access data anytime

**Data correctness:** Immutable ledger generates cryptography proof for every change of database. No such changes can be done without notice.
