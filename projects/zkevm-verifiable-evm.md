# ðŸ“Ÿ zkEVM: Verifiable EVM

Weâ€™re using **soundness** and **completeness** properties of **Zero-Knowledge Proof** (PLONK) to build up a Verifiable Executor version of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This approach allowed to move all expensive on-chain computation to off-chain.

Our zkEVM (Verifiable EVM, vEVM) is also an EVM, there is no need for any unique toolchains to develop smart contracts for zkEVM. The migration cost would be minimized to zero.
